The web application for BallotBox is written using Ruby on Rails v4.1.5 on top of Ruby 2.1.2.

Features Implemented:
* User Authentication (via the Devise Ruby Gem)
* Election creation -- currently just a title and text description
* Show, Edit, and Destroy functionality for all elections
* Restricted access to Edit and Destroy functions (i.e. only creators of an election can edit/destory)
* Basic navigation bar (via Bootstrap)

Features In Progress:
* Mobile apps - Android & iPhone
